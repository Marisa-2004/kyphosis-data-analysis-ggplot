# Exploratory data analysis

Here I upload my first ever github project. Kyphosis is a condition that causes an excessive curvature of vertebral columns
Through my analysis using the library ggplot and making use of different variables available in my data set I have performed an exploratory data analysis
This helps us understand how different factors favour the presence of kyohosis.
